## Introduction 💡

This application allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific location. By utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API and integrating Chart.js, I aimed to strengthen my knowledge in working with external APIs, data visualization, and creating seamless user experiences.

## Features ✨

1. Weather Search: Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city in the search field.

2. Dynamic Temperature Chart: The application displays a temperature chart that dynamically updates based on the current time. The chart showcases temperature data from the current time to 21:00 (9:00 PM) of the same day. The API provides data for specific hours (00h, 03h, 06h, 09h, 12h, 15h, 18h, and 21h), so if the current time is, for example, 14:00 (2:00 PM), the chart displays temperatures from 15:00 (3:00 PM) to 21:00 (9:00 PM).
